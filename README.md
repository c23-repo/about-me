# About-me
This repository is a project about me. This is a test of my development skills starting from zero. Through the several commit's that will be submitted, I will be able to track my progress. This project is a combination of HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript; the two latter languages are to be linked into the index.html and function smoothly, with functions!


This code was refactored through pair programming with Paula Thomas as the Driver and Cristian Restrepo acting as Navigator.
